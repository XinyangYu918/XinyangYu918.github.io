Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the **Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre**, King’s College London.  

My research lies at the intersection of **psychiatry**, **neuroscience**, and **multi-omics**, with a focus on eating disorders, disordered eating behaviors, and adolescent psychopathology.

I integrate **multi-modal neuroimaging**, **DNA methylation**, and **longitudinal analysis** to understand the biological mechanisms of mental health across human development.

### 🔬 Research Interests

My research aims to elucidate the biological and developmental underpinnings of mental disorders and disordered eating by integrating large-scale multimodal data across:

- **Neuroimaging**: Longitudinal analysis of region-specific and whole-brain developmental patterns using structural (cortical thickness, surface area, subcortical volumes) and functional MRI data, focusing on adolescence and early adulthood.
- **Epigenomics**: Analysis of DNA methylation data to identify CpG sites and regulatory regions associated with brain structure, eating behaviors, and psychiatric phenotypes. Methods include epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), construction of methylation risk scores, and application of epigenetic clocks to assess biological age acceleration in relation to mental health.
- **Transcriptomics and Genomics**: Integration of peripheral gene expression profiles and genome-wide association study (GWAS)–derived polygenic scores to investigate molecular pathways and genetic liability underlying disordered eating, obesity, and adolescent psychopathology. Analyses include functional annotation, gene set enrichment, and Mendelian randomisation.  

My background combines **medical laboratory**, **psychology**, and **psychiatric genetics**, and I have published in journals such as *Nature Mental Health* and *Biological Psychiatry*.
